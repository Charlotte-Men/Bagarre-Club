# Welcome to Bagarre CLUB's repo !

⚡ This project has been created during 5 weeks and was organized by Wild Code School.<br/>
The theme was free, we had to code an app that uses API, and we chose a superhero one because it's fun ! 🦸🏾‍♀️🦹‍♂️🦸🏻‍♂️🦹🏿‍♀️<br/><br/>
Our team was formed by Vincent Lejeune, Isabelle Maitre Jean, Philippe Moty and I, Charlotte Ménard. <br/>
🤜This project uses Javascript, React, Node.js and CSS3 🤛<br/><br/>
